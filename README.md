# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This app is written in Python 3 using the TensorFlow library and Keras to build a neural network for image classification. Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow. In this case, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was created using multiple layers of convolutional and pooling layers. The network was trained using datasets found on Kaggle.
